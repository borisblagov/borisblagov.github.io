      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of the Business Cycle analysis that I have conducted either as part of understanding economic issues or as part of the regular forecasts of the RWI. The RWI &amp;ndash; Leibniz Institute for Economic Research conducts a quarterly analysis of the business cycle developments in Germany and the world economy since 1954. This analysis includes a detailed forecast for the international economy bi-annually, in March and September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are a team of experts with years of experience (for some members - decades) and we use cutting edge methods to create a thorough economic forecast for Germany and over 30 other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
