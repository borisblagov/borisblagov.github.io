      <title>September 2019: Global economic downturn continues</title>
      <link>/publication/2019_kb_q3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic development has differed across sectors. While service sectors are still expanding quite robustly, the weakness of eco-nomic growth can be attributed to manufacturing. Economic policy is likely to have contributed to this slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trade conflict between the USA and China has intensified in recent months, despite temporary signs of a de-escalation. The US has either already increased customs duties on many goods from China or pledged to do so in the future. China has answered by imposing own customs duties on various American products. The escalation of the trade conflicts worldwide is likely to have a significant impact on the global economy throughout the forecast period. Moreover, future rela-tions between the EU and Great Britain, given Britain’s currently probable withdrawal from the EU, are a significant source of uncertainty. The in part erratic economic policy increases uncertainty for businesses and by this has likely contributed to the current weakness in investment activity - accompanied by the slowdowns in the world trade and the manufactur-ing industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the forecast horizon, we expect the current economic landscape to remain broadly unchanged. In view of the bleak economic outlook, eco-nomic policy, particularly in the form of monetary policy, should attempt to stimulate the economy. The Fed has already lowered its key interest rates in July. However, the global economic expansion is likely to further weaken in coming year. After growth of 2.8% this year, we expect a somewhat lower growth of 2.6% in 2020. In 2021 global production is expected to increase to 2.8%. The inflationary pressure is likely to remain moderate due to the low economic pace.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>June 2019: The German economy loses momentum</title>
      <link>/publication/2019_kb_q2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having stagnated in the second half of 2018 GDP growth gained momentum  in  the  first  quarter  of  2019.  However,  leading  indicators  such  as  business  confidence and new orders suggest that growth rates will recede in the rest of this year. Domestic demand is expected to continue growing owed to incomes improving further. On the other hand, foreign demand will have a dampening effect on the German economy, since trade policy has taken a more protectionist stance in many countries. Summing up, GDP is expected to grow by 0.8% in this year and 1.4% in the next. The moderation of growth leaves its trace in the labor market. Unemployment rate should decline  slightly  only  to  5.0%  in  this  year  and  4.9%  in  the  next.  Inflation  will  remain  moderate;  consumer  prices  level  will  increase  by  1.3%  in  this  year  and  1.4%  in  the  next. The fiscal balance will still show a surplus, but the latter will become smaller over the forecast horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​Mainstream economics is about isolating key questions that may be analysed in a theoretical framework. In practice the economy is an extremely complex global phenomenon, where everything happens as an outcome of the interaction of millions of people. The goal of this course is to provide a bridge between the theory and practice in economics from the perspective of the global financial crisis. By employing knowledge from various aspects of economics, as they are presented in the first and second years of study you will learn: (i) How even the most basic macroeconomic model can describe the challenges faced by the policy-makers throughout the global financial crisis. (ii) How the crisis unfolded and what made it different than previous economic downturns. (iii) How and why the different countries reacted differently to the crisis, what “unconventional monetary policy” is and how that might be the future of policy-makers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>March 2019: Global economy on the decline</title>
      <link>/publication/2019_kb_q1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Mar 2019 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/publication/2019_kb_q1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of global economic expansion continued to decline at the beginning of this year. The slowdown continued in the manufacturing sector in particular, which had already lost momentum in the past year. In the final quarter of the year, overall economic production expanded at a somewhat slower pace, particularly in the two major economies USA and China. In the Euro Area, it rose at the same rate as in the previous quarter. In Japan, demand expanded again in the final quarter after a temporary decline. Against this backdrop, corporate sentiment continued to deteriorate at the beginning of the year. As a result, the possibility of an impending recession is more frequently discussed in the media. This was particularly noticeable at the turn of the year 2018&amp;ndash;2019. After that, these fears seem to have lessened somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of supporting factors lead to the assessment that the global economy will weaken but not slide into recession. From a sector perspective, the fact that the increasingly important service sector is still expanding quite strongly worldwide does not  indicate that we approach an end of the upswing. In addition, purchasing power is increasing due to the decline in crude oil prices at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of the slowing pace of the economic expansion and lower inflation, at least in the short term, the central banks have decelerated the pace of monetary tightening somewhat. By contrast, the orientation of fiscal policy varies across countries. In the USA, the impulses from the tax cuts are easing which tends to dampen economic demand. In Japan and China, by contrast, public spending is even planned to increase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global economic expansion is likely to slow only marginally in the forecast period. The slowdown will be more pronounced in the major economies, where the upswing has been going on for some time. By contrast, it is likely to accelerate in some economies, such as Latin America. On balance, growth rates are expected to remain close to the long-term average.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it is expected that the expansion of the global economy will continue to slow in the forecast period. We expect global GDP to expand by 3.0% this year and by 2.8% next year. World trade is likely to expand at rates of 2.5% and 3.0% next year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be attending &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.side-iea.it/events/iceee/iceee-2019&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ICEEE 2019&lt;/a&gt; conference in Lecce, Italy where I will present my paper &lt;a href=&#34;/publication/2018_eru/&#34;&gt;Exchange rate uncertainty and import prices in the euro area&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Friday, the 25-th&lt;/strong&gt;. My talk will take place in &lt;strong&gt;Room 3&lt;/strong&gt; of Building 6 (Campus Studium 2000) in the session from &lt;strong&gt;14:30 to 16:10&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have created a calendar &lt;code&gt;.ics&lt;/code&gt; file which mimics page 3 from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.side-iea.it/sites/side-iea.it/files/iceee2019lecce_final_program.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;. You may import it in your calendar app and add the Rooms to the sessions that you want to attend. The events have &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; notifications by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the .ics &lt;a href=&#34;ICEEE2019.ics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have successfully imported it should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello from my new webpage!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am migrating from my &lt;a href=&#34;www.borisblagov.wixsite.com/home&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wix website&lt;/a&gt;. My previous webpage was rather slow and resource intensive and most of all updating anything required quite a bit of effort on my part. This website is built with &lt;a href=&#34;www.gohugo.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and is a pleasure to make, so I am confident that I can stay on schedule with updating this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to the creator of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://georgecushen.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;George Cushen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
