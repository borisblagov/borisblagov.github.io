      <description>I will be attending ICEEE 2019 conference in Lecce, Italy where I will present my paper Exchange rate uncertainty and import prices in the euro area on Friday, the 25-th. My talk will take place in Room 3 of Building 6 (Campus Studium 2000) in the session from 14:30 to 16:10.
I have created a calendar .ics file which mimics page 3 from the program. You may import it in your calendar app and add the Rooms to the sessions that you want to attend.</description>

      <description>Hello from my new webpage!
I am migrating from my wix website. My previous webpage was rather slow and resource intensive and most of all updating anything required quite a bit of effort on my part. This website is built with Hugo and is a pleasure to make, so I am confident that I can stay on schedule with updating this one.
Shoutout to the creator of the theme - George Cushen.</description>
