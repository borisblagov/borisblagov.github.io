In the second half  of  the  year  the  moderation  was  aggravated  by  problems  in  the  automotive  sector  implementing the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). The latter will lose its dampening influence in the next months. Furthermore, the economy will be stimulated by an expansionary fiscal stance. Nevertheless, the expansion will continue to be moderate. Foreign demand remains lackluster. On the domestic side, labor shortages, strong price increases in the construction sector, and a restructuring in the automotive sector will weigh on growth. We forecast GDP to grow by only 1.4% in 2019 and 1.6% in 2020, of which 0.4 percentage points represent a working day effect. Inflation will slow down in view of the oil price having already declined. Employment is expected to grow more slowly, but unemployment will continue to recede. The more expansionary fiscal  stance  will  lead  to  a  reduction  of  the  general  government  surplus  from  1.6%  in  relation to GDP in 2018 to 1.0% in 2019 and 0.8% in 2020.","tags":[],"title":"December 2018: German economy under the sign of the automotive industry","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Blagov"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1544888213,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544888213,"objectID":"2eaaca543ec7018917579f5d7d882a61","permalink":"/publication/2018_eru/","publishdate":"2018-12-15T16:36:53+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_eru/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper analyses the effects of exchange rate uncertainty on the pricing behaviour of import firms in the euro area. Uncertainty is measured via the volatility of the structural shocks to the exchange rate in a non-linear VAR framework and is an important determinant of import prices. An increase in exchange rate uncertainty is associated with a fall in prices on average, which suggests that the exchange rate risk is borne by the importers. The analysis utilizes a dataset on industrial import prices, disaggregated by origin of imports. Controlling for intra- and extra-euro area trade is important.","tags":["Uncertainty"],"title":"Exchange rate uncertainty and import prices in the euro area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["RWI (Essen)","DIW (Berlin)","the ifo Institute (Munich)","IfW (Kiel)","IWH (Halle)"],"categories":["Forecasts"],"content":"","date":1538042400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538042400,"objectID":"bc41d78890f4d9bb05a7072fef30ed0f","permalink":"/publication/2018_gd_q3/","publishdate":"2018-09-27T11:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_gd_q3/","section":"publication","summary":"Germany’s leading economics research institutes have downwardly revised their forecasts for 2018 and 2019.

The endogenously estimated discrete regime shifts are made dependent on macroeconomic fundamentals. This enables us to determine which changes in macroeconomic variables can trigger switches between the low and high credibility regimes. We carry out extensive testing to search for the most appropriate specification of the Markov regime‐switching model. We find strong evidence of regime switching behaviour that portrays the time‐varying nature of credibility in the historical data.","tags":["Markov-switching","VAR","interest rate premia"],"title":"The credibility of Hong Kong's currency board system: looking through the prism of MS‐VAR models with time‐varying transition probabilities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Blagov","Michael Funke","Richhild Moessner"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1446392213,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446392213,"objectID":"d699422c6464d5feb8a44305396bde3c","permalink":"/publication/2015_bis/","publishdate":"2015-11-01T16:36:53+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_bis/","section":"publication","summary":"Using  a  Markov-switching  VAR  with  endogenous transition  probabilities, we  analyse  what has triggered the interest rate pass-through impairment for Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal.

We also find that the ECB’s unconventional  monetary  policy  announcements  have  had  temporary  positive  effects  in  Italy. Due  to  the  zero  lower  bound  these  findings  are  amplified  if  EONIA  is  used  as  a  measure  of the policy rate.
