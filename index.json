Uncertainty is measured via the volatility of the structural shocks to the exchange rate in a non-linear VAR framework and is an important determinant of import prices. An increase in exchange rate uncertainty is associated with a fall in prices on average, which suggests that the exchange rate risk is borne by the importers. The analysis utilizes a dataset on industrial import prices, disaggregated by origin of imports. Controlling for intra- and extra-euro area trade is important.","tags":["Uncertainty"],"title":"Exchange rate uncertainty and import prices in the euro area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Blagov","Michael Funke"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1522597013,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1522597013,"objectID":"ab644bf8f7101a310b2ec50e0262f88d","permalink":"/publication/2018_md/","publishdate":"2018-04-01T16:36:53+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_md/","section":"publication","summary":"An estimated Markov-switching DSGE modeling framework that allows for parameter shifts across regimes is employed to test the hypothesis of regime-dependent credibility of Hong Kongâ€™s linked exchange rate system. The baseline model distinguishes two regimes with respect to the time-series properties of the risk premium. Regime-dependent impulse responses to macroeconomic shocks reveal substantial differences in spreads. To test the sensitivity of the results, a number of robustness checks are performed. The findings contribute to efforts at modeling exchange rate regime credibility as a nonlinear process with two distinct regimes.","tags":["Markov-switching","DSGE"],"title":"The regime-dependent evolution of credibility: a fresh look at Hong Kong's linked exchange rate system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Blagov"],"categories":["Research"],"content":"","date":1491728400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491728400,"objectID":"ef2c68af37e7e615113e084191052ee4","permalink":"/publication/2017_ee/","publishdate":"2017-04-09T10:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017_ee/","section":"publication","summary":"Under a currency board, the central bank relinquishes control over its monetary policy and domestic interest rates converge towards the foreign rates. Nevertheless, a spread between both usually remains. This spread can be persistently positive due to elevated risk in the economy. This paper models that feature by building a DSGE model with a currency board, where the domestic interest rate is endogenously derived as a function of the foreign rate, the external debt position and an exogenous risk premium component. Time variation in the volatility of the risk premium component is then modelled via a Markov-switching component. Estimating the model with Bayesian methods and Estonian data shows that the economy does not react much to shocks to domestic interest rates in quiet times but is much more sensitive during crises, and matches the financial and banking crises, which cannot be captured by the standard DSGE model.","tags":["Markov-switching","DSGE"],"title":"Financial crises and time-varying risk premia in a small open economy: a Markov-switching DSGE model for Estonia","type":"publication"}]
