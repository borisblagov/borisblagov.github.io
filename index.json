Overall economic activity in the industrialized countries was 9.8% lower than in the first quarter. World trade also collapsed in the spring. At its lowest point in May, it was 17.2% below the level before the pandemic outbreak in December 2019.\nEconomic policy has adopted extensive measures to support the economy. Monetary policy has lowered interest rates and expanded asset purchase. Fiscal policy adopted extensive measures to support incomes of the private sector.\nThe latest monthly indicators on industrial production, consumer, and business sentiment suggest a strong recovery of the economic activity over the summer. The beginning of this rebound generally coincides with the decline of new infections and the associated gradual lifting of infection control measures. In June, the volume of world trade recovered significantly and the RWI/ISL container index rose noticeably in July. Daily mobility data also point to a gradual normalization of economic activity in many economic sectors. Tourism, however, is a major exception.\nAgainst this background, we expect a significant contraction in GDP of 4.6% for this year. This decline is due to the significant slump in overall economic activity throughout the first half. For the second half of the current year, we expect a significant recovery of the economy. In the third quarter in particular, economic activity should increase significantly due to catchup effects. Inflation should remain moderate due to weak demand and base effects in energy prices. We expect prices to rise by 1.8% this year.\nTowards the end of the forecast horizon the pace of the rebound is likely to slow significantly, compared with the second half of 2020. We expect GDP to increase by 5.4% in 2021. In 2022, overall economic activity is expected to expand by 3.5%. Production should therefore return to its pre-crisis level in 2021. The upward trend in prices should pick up slightly as capacity utilization increases. We expect an inflation rate of 2.1% in 2021 and a mild increase to 2.2% in 2022.\n","date":1600167600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600167600,"objectID":"b62e21110f7e6c06e8c204ce5bf1b4c2","permalink":"/forecast/forecast_kb_20_3/","publishdate":"2020-09-15T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/forecast/forecast_kb_20_3/","section":"forecast","summary":"The RWI - Leibniz Institute for Economic Research latest economic forecast.

The analysis was finalized on the 19th of March 2020 and therefore does not include newer developments. This translation is my own and is therefore not affiliated with RWI - Leibniz Institute for economic research in any way. All the errors are my own.\nSummary Assuming that\n production in Italy will fall by 20% and remain at that level for two months International arrivals and overnight stays will decline by 75% (the rest attributed to essential travel) Consumption will fall by 50% (proxied by new car registrations) we estimate that Italian GDP will contract by 2,4% instead of growing with 0,2%  Background In the RWI Spring forecast of 2020 we analysed the effects of nationwide lockdown in Italy on its economy. Italy was, at the time, the hardest hit economy by the new strand of coronavirus. The high number of deaths compared to the number of confirmed infections suggested that COVID-19 has remained undiscovered for some time. Thus, it may very well be that a portion of the population might be carrying the virus unbeknownst to them. Therefore, the Italian government introduced a number of stringent measures in order to contain the virus.\n On the 3-rd of March Italy ordered the temporary closure of schools and universities until 15 March. It is also advised to cancel or postpone all major public meetings until 3 April. On the 8-th of March, large parts of northern Italy, such as Lombardy and 14 other provinces, were quarantined, also until 3rd of April. These measures were later extended to the whole country. Since 11-th March all shops except grocery stores remain closed After the publication of the forecast Italy has introduced a total lockdown of the country  The measures are likely to have a massive impact on the Italian economy. In addition to quarantine, the tourism sector, which accounts for 13% of Italy\u0026rsquo;s GDP and employs 8 million people, will continue to suffer from the effects of the virus even after the quarantine measures have ended.\nModelling strategy To estimate the economic effects of these drastic measures, we use a cutting edge econometric model, namely, a mixed-frequency VAR (MF-VAR) model analogous to Schorfheide and Song (2015) (for a brief description see also Döhrn et al. 2018).\nWe capture the effects in the following manner. First we choose a range of economic variables that cover all areas of the Italian economy where possible. Then\n Using data prior to the outbreak we do a forecast for Gross domestic product and Personal consumption. This is our counterfactual scenario - what would have happened if COVID-19 did not paralyse the economy. Making an educated guess regarding the developments of key variables under the current circumstances, create a new forecast. This is our Covid-19 scenario.  The difference between the two is our expectation of the effects.\nData The model includes three quarterly variables and twelve monthly indicators. These have been selected to cover all areas of the Italian economy where possible. Specifically, the following variables are used:\n Production: GDP (quarterly), gross fixed capital formation (quarterly), industrial production and new orders Survey-based measures: IHS Markit Purchasing Managers Index, Economic Sentiment Index and Industrial Confidence Index Preise: Consumer Price Index and Producer Price index Labour market: Unemployment rate and Employment Consumption: Private Consumption (quarterly), Retail Sales and New car registration Tourism: Number of tourist arrivals and number of hotel nights Data used are from 2000 onwards. Monthly data are available until December 2019 and January 2020 respectively, survey results are already available until February 2020. Quarterly variables extend to the fourth quarter of 2019  Establishing the counterfactual scenario (without COVID-19) The available data do not currently cover the period from the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Therefore, the data are suitable for counterfactual nowcasting. We use the model to forecast all variables, which represent a hypothetical alternative scenario of a development that would have occurred if Italy had not been covered by COVID-19. The forecasts are shown in red on the figures below. Industrial production falls slightly in February, but then recovers again. The upward trend in tourist arrivals continues. The number of overnight stays is also gradually increasing. These forecasts, together with the already available strong growth in industrial production in January, suggest that GDP will expand by 0.2% in the first quarter. For the remainder of the forecast period, there will be a slower increase in overall economic activity for the rest of the year. Overall, this alternative scenario results in an annual average increase in GDP of 0.2%.\nThe effects of COVID-19 on the Italian economy In view of the latest developments in Italy - confirmed COVID-19 cases in all regions, quarantine in Northern Italy and a general travel ban as well as the cancellation of major events and store closures - we assume the following assumptions regarding the current economic development\n The number of international arrivals and overnight stays will fall sharply by 75% for March and April and will not begin to recover until May. We attribute the remaining 25% of international arrivals to necessary travel. The level of industrial production plummets, is 20% lower in March than in January, and remains unchanged in April. Car registrations fall by 50% in March and, like industrial production, remain at this level for another month.  We plot those assumptions on Figure 1.\n Assumptions on the effects of COVID-19 on industrial production, new arrivals, overnight stays and car registrations (red) and conuterfactual scenario (blue).   Based on the experience of the quarantine measures taken in China (Wu \u0026amp; McGoogan 2020), we expect the situation to get better from May onwards. In the three months past May there will be a return to the original level of the four variables. In tourism, the level of both variables remains about 5% below the counterfactual scenario in the summer. With the help of an MF-VAR these variables are forecast for the period from October 2020 onwards. In Figure 1, the developments are shown in blue. An overshoot over the values of the counterfactual scenario is to be expected for industrial production and new car registrations.\nFigure 2 shows the model forecasts for GDP and private consumption. If the virus had not spread, both aggregates would have risen at decreasing rates, but consistently. Under the assumptions made here, the spread of COVID-19 is likely to reduce real GDP and private consumption significantly in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year, expansion rates should then be well above potential rates due to catch-up effects. All in all, the overall economic activity in Italy is expected to decline by 2.4% this year. In contrast, GDP and consumer spending will rise by 0.2% in the alternative scenario, while private consumption is likely to decline by 0.9% in 2020. This results in a negative GDP effect of COVID-19 of about 2.6% on GDP and 1.1% on private consumption.\n The effects of COVID-19 on Gross domestic product (left) and Personal consumption (right) in red versus the counterfactual scernaio in blue.   This forecast is based on the key assumptions of fall in production by 20%, tourism by 75%, and consumption for larger assets such as cars by 50%. In the light of the current situation these values appear optimistic, thus we may observe an even sharper decline.\n","date":1584961200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585738800,"objectID":"587e7fe02f0158747c45e7bd68daba85","permalink":"/post/2020_03_29/","publishdate":"2020-03-23T11:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020_03_29/","section":"post","summary":"This is an excerpt from our [2020 spring economic forecast](https://www.rwi-essen.de/media/content/pages/publikationen/rwi-konjunkturberichte/rwi-kb_1-2020.pdf)","tags":["Forecasts"],"title":"The effects of COVID-19 on the Italian economy","type":"post"},{"authors":["Boris Blagov","Roland Döhrn","Daniela Grozea-Helmenstein","Philipp Jäger","Martin Micheli","Klaus Weyerstraß"],"categories":null,"content":"Since early 2020, the world economy is in the grip of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nevertheless, a spread between both usually remains. This spread can be persistently positive due to elevated risk in the economy. This paper models that feature by building a DSGE model with a currency board, where the domestic interest rate is endogenously derived as a function of the foreign rate, the external debt position and an exogenous risk premium component. Time variation in the volatility of the risk premium component is then modelled via a Markov-switching component. Estimating the model with Bayesian methods and Estonian data shows that the economy does not react much to shocks to domestic interest rates in quiet times but is much more sensitive during crises, and matches the financial and banking crises, which cannot be captured by the standard DSGE model.","tags":["Uncertainty","International Economics","DSGE","Markov Switching","Stochastic volatility"],"title":"Financial crises and time-varying risk premia in a small open economy: a Markov-switching DSGE model for Estonia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Blagov","Michael Funke"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467799200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467799200,"objectID":"28c5b7bfdd31d3982e1b596d436d9594","permalink":"/publication/2016_ob/","publishdate":"2019-08-16T11:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2016_ob/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper employs a Markov regime‐switching VAR model to describe and analyse the time‐varying credibility of Hong Kong's currency board system.
